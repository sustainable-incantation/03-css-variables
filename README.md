# CSS Variables

We all know about **Sass** and **variables** used in it. 

*So why are we discussing about CSS Variables if we already have a way to define them in Sass?*  
There is something that CSS Variables can do and Sass Variables can't.  
##### CSS Variables can be modified at run-time using JS, whereas Sass variables are set at compile-time and thus can't be modified later.  

***That is why we use CSS Variables.***
